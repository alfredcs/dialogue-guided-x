This mobile-friendly web app provides some basic demos to test the vision capabilities of GPT-4V.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) was selected as a framework for this project to enable rapid prototyping of new ideas.

      <code>An unexpected traveler struts confidently across the asphalt, its iridescent feathers gleaming in the sunlight. This wild turkey, with its distinctive fan of tail feathers on full display, appears unfazed by the nearby human presence. A dash of wilderness encounters suburbia as the bird navigates between nature and civilization. The scene is a gentle reminder of the ever-present connection between human and animal territories.</code>

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
> [How can I access GPT-4?](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4)

## Local setup

Here's how you can get started.

1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/logicalroot/gpt-4v-demos.git
cd gpt-4v-demos
```
2. Install the necessary packages:
```
pip install streamlit
```
3. Run the application:
```
streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```
4. To remove the missing secrets warning, create a blank `secrets.toml` file in your `.streamlit` folder.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid inputting your OpenAI API key every run, you can add it to `secrets.toml` with the following line. Paste your key between the double quotes.
> ```
> OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR KEY"
> ```
> For safety, ensure `secrets.toml` is in your `.gitignore` file.

## Limitations

To use the camera input on iOS devices, Streamlit must be configured to use SSL. See [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/https-support).
